/**
 * Created by larryliu on 5/13/16.
 * Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. if the stack gets too high, it might topple. Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when
 * the previous stack exceeds some threshold. Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetofStacks should be composed of several stacks
 * and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity. SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop() should behave identically to a single
 * stack (that is, pop() should return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack).
 *
 * Follow up:
 * Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop operation on a specific sub-stack.
